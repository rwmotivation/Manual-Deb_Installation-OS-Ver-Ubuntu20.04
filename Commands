Find out the dependencies required.Find out the missing package from searching it from https://packages.ubuntu.com/
You can find our the exact package by scrolling down to the page and doing a exact search of package for your current OS of usage 
Next step is to choose the architeture of your machine  like AMD64 etc. 
Now you can download the file from the page 
And run the following commands 

dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb
(This command is specially useful if you want to check what is being installed beforehand.)

dpkg-deb --extract /path/to/file.deb
(Extract All Files from a Deb Package)

sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb
(Install a Deb File Using Dpkg)

sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file.deb
(The above command will install the standalone deb package only, without any dependencies.
To fix this, you will have to run a command to auto-install required dependencies. 
Otherwise your system may be left in a broken state. To fix the unmet dependency issue, run the command below:)

sudo apt -f install

You can also  Install a Deb File Using Gdebi
To install gdebi in Ubuntu, run the command below:

$ sudo apt install gdebi
To install a “.deb” package using Gdebi, run the command below:

$ sudo gdebi /path/to/file.deb
(Since gdebi will take care of installation of dependencies, 
you don’t have to manually run another command to fix broken packages. 
However, if you want to check if there are broken packages or not 
and fix them automatically, 
you can run the command mentioned above again:)

$ sudo apt -f install

Using Apt to Install a Deb Package
$ sudo apt install /path/to/file.deb

$ sudo apt install ./file.deb
(If you launched terminal inside the directory of “.deb” file)

$ sudo apt install ./file.deb
(Like gdebi, apt will automatically install 
all the required dependencies)

$ sudo apt -f install

check the version of the package i.e run the below command 
curl --version
